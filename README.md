# Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV

### Explanation
###### Import Libraries: Essential libraries for image processing, deep learning, and data manipulation.
###### Load and Preprocess Data: Reads images, resizes them, and prepares training and testing datasets.
###### Build the Model: Constructs a convolutional neural network with layers for convolution, pooling, flattening, and dense connections.
###### Data Augmentation: Applies transformations to the training data to improve the model's robustness.
###### Train the Model: Fits the model to the training data with real-time data augmentation.
###### Evaluate the Model: Checks the accuracy of the model on the test data.
###### Real-time Facial Expression Recognition: Utilizes the trained model to detect and classify facial expressions in real-time using a webcam.
